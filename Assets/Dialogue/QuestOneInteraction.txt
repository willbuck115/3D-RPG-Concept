Howdy stranger! I don't think I've ever seen you round these parts before. What's your name?
-?????
I.. I don't know.
-Harvey
What do you mean? You know what it doesn't matter. I know we just met but I'm in desperate need of some help
I was sent out to gather some fresh apples from the trees in this area but I also need some firewood. Can you help me?
***OPTION***
%ACCEPT_Good! I need 10 apples. You can grab apples by shaking the trees with your mouse!
%DECLINE_Okay. Come and see me if you change your mind!
*Reward Phase*
-Harvey
Thankyou so much! Really! you don't understand how much you've helped me. I must reward you in some way.
